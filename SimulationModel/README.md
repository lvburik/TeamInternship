### Matlab Finite element model
this folder hosts a MATLAB finite element model for simulating our samples. 

## running the model
change parameters in the run_FEM_sims.m file and run it. This will run the specified amount of simulations. each simulation will be for a random sample with a number of defects. At a random depth.

## results
the results are stored in a CSV file containing node_ID, node coordinates, labels (specifying if a node has damage behind it) and temperature data.


## LegacyFiles
the legacyfiles folder contains a older version of the model.
